  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> strongly believes in open source software. They support and contribute to the open source community in a number of ways — supplying their own code, supporting other projects by donating software, and sponsoring Java User Groups.</p>

<p>We are both extremely pleased and grateful that Atlassian has descided to support our open source effort with TideSDK. As a result, we have received the following assistance:</p>

<ul>
<li>JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)</li>
<li>GreenHopper for JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)</li>
<li>Bonfire for JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)</li>
<li>FishEye/Crucible OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)</li>
<li>Bamboo OnDemand 100 Remote Agents, Unlimited Jobs (Community)</li>
<li>Confluence OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)</li>
</ul>


<p>In fact, we&#8217;ve already been making great use of the software. <a href="https://github.com/nazcasistemas">nazcasistemas</a> has imported the legacy of Titanium Desktop for reference while <a href="https://github.com/dubcanada">dubcanada</a> has reviewed the issue history for issues we are bringing forward for categorization and to align these with our release goals.</p>

<p>Many thanks Atlassian for your generous support!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our team has been working hard to build the software inherited from Appcelerator across all supported operating systems. More than clean builds, we are looking for the execution of automated tests as well as the artefacts from each build.</p>

<p>Building TideSDK is extremely time consuming. Our developers must be also be in tune with impacts of commits to the repository on the code base across operating systems. We tweeted not so long ago that Matt <a href="https://github.com/matthewh">https://github.com/matthewh</a> has recently helped the project with server capacity for our Continuous integration (CI) system. He has also been working to get Jenkins set up and configured.</p>

<p>We were pleased to have our first passing build on MacOSX 10.6.8 on Jenkins, June 24. This was an important milestone for us.</p>

<p><img src="http://tidesdk.github.com/images/jenkins-ci.png" alt="Jenkins CI" /></p>

<p>Virtual machines are now being setup for MacOSX 10.7.3, Windows 7 and for Linux. We plan to support Ubuntu and Fedora to start. This may be expanded.</p>

<p>One of the great features of continuous builds is the artefacts obtained followin each build. Our users will benefit from Nightly Builds that we will be making available to tha the current state of our software can be evaluated. Look for a <em>Nightly builds</em> link on our website at <a href="http://www.tidesdk.org">http://www.tidesdk.org</a> shortly.</p>

<p>Find out more about TideSDK by joining our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidesdk">mailing list</a> at or drop by our irc at #tidesdk on freenode.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inheriting a project can make for some surprises. One recently for me has been reviewing the Tag history in Git. To my surprise, much of the tag history of Titanium Deskto is, well, just not available.</p>

<p>Up until the time Appcelerator decided to discontinue the project, there was a progression of release candidates (RC&#8217;s) publicly to 1.2.0.RC6e. That said, where are the tags? Perhaps someone from Appcelerator can fully explain. Creating a tags are a helpful legacy. I invite the maintainers to comment on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our team has been working to get Drillbit running and sucessfully passing unit tests. This is in anticipation of connecting to our Continuous Integration system late this week. After a commit to our repository, TideSDK gets built on a variety of operating systems and the unit tests will be executed. This will advise the team of the status of these builds at any time and also provide downloads at the current state.</p>

<p>There are a total of 4619 assertions made in the tests. Currently 85 tests are failing but this is already much better that where we started originally. We continue to progress. The unit test failures are primarily in the language and process modules.</p>

<p>The following is a screenshot of the unit testing and current status:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our Wiki located at <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki">https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki</a> continues to grow by leaps and bounds. We are receiving a lot of great information from the community and ask that you continue to share any valuable documents or media you may encounter concerning Titanium Desktop (the legacy SDK that TideSDK is growing upon). Much of this knowledge will live on through TideSDK to support our future users.</p>

<p>Join our mailing list to identify your find at</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tidesdk/B7k9KyVa3yg">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tidesdk/B7k9KyVa3yg</a></p>

<p>or just let us know by chatting with us on IRC at #tidesdk on freenode.</p>

<p>Frankly, we want to set an example in our project for the level of documentation and support we will deliver to users and developers alike. Truly, we believe that high levels of documentation and community support will translate into more satisfied users and contributors to the project. We have some very good technology that will continue to improve.</p>

<p>While folks patiently await our first release candidate, we will continue to provide Titanium Desktop from our downloads area at</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads">https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads</a></p>

<p>When TideSDK is released, there will be no changes in the API. If you have no experience the Titanium Desktop and would like to get started on a Desktop app today, you can begin here (and transition to TideSDK as soon as we release it in the very near future).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our Friday session with Marshall Culpepper was to say the least &#8216;awesome&#8217;. We are very grateful to have his support for the TideSDK project. As you may be aware, Marshall was TiDesktop&#8217;s original developer and kroll was his &#8216;baby&#8217;. The session was well attended and our group benefitted immensely from Marshall&#8217;s insights.</p>

<p>Guiding the session using an outline prepared in advance, we gained from his knowledge of the past, discussed our present challenges, and looked toward the future. The session which ran a marathon 3+ hours, documented important legacy information, offered clarity concerning details of our project&#8217;s architecture, helped with issues around our drillbit testing framework, our development approach, library upgrades, packaging, distribution and much more.</p>

<p>The session ended with pledges to keep in touch along with a followup as we contemplate the challenges of Apple sandbox compliance. You will find a complete transcript of the session at:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Join us for a scheduled Q &amp; A session with Marshall Culpepper, original developer of Titanium Desktop Friday June 15 at 3PM EDT / 1PM PDT on #tidesdk on freenode. We will be consulting on the architecture, potential, and priorities for TideSDK. In the interim, you can acquaint yourself with Marshall and his creation with the slideshare below. We are excited to have Marshall&#8217;s support and hope you are too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Appcelerator&#8217;s announced the discontinuation of Titanium Destkop, we have been  concerned about the potential loss and disappearance of valuable media, articles and knowledge that has accumulated over time about this great product.</p>

<p>We need your eyes and actions to help us gather valuable media, articles, tutorials, sample apps, slide presentations (slideshares) and any other valuable knowledge that may help future users of TideSDK.</p>

<p>Please post your findings on our Google group at:</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups&amp;hl=en#!topic/tidesdk/B7k9KyVa3yg">TiDesktop Archive</a></p>

<p>I believe anyone involved in this effort will be surprised about the wealth of information floating around that we must collect up and preserve.</p>

<p>Please join in our crowdsourced effort.</p>
